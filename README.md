<h4> About the Project</h4>

This is a password generator using XKCD password generator


I used commmon words file to generate number of words. 


I used arrays to generate number and special characters

I also implemented max input number to less than 10  and restricted input data to numbers only.

<h4>Note to TA<h4>


I did not use logic file, all my code is in index.php

<h4> No plugins were used in this project</h4>
